# Calendar View

Since v3.2, AB includes a calendar view that shows your subscribed anime organized by broadcast day.

## Features

### Weekly Schedule

The calendar displays anime organized by their broadcast weekday (Monday through Sunday), plus an "Unknown" column for anime without broadcast schedule data.

### Bangumi.tv Integration

AB fetches broadcast schedule data from Bangumi.tv to accurately display when each anime airs.

Click the **Refresh schedule** button to update the broadcast data.

### Grouped Display

Since v3.2, anime with multiple download rules are grouped together:

- Same anime appears once, even with multiple subtitle group rules
- Click on a grouped anime to see all available rules
- Select a specific rule to edit

This keeps the calendar clean while still providing access to all your rules.

## Navigation

Click on any anime poster in the calendar to:
- View anime details
- Edit download rules
- Access archive/disable options

## Tips

::: tip
If an anime appears in the "Unknown" column, it may not have broadcast data on Bangumi.tv, or the anime title couldn't be matched.
